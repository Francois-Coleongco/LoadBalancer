A custom-built HTTP load balancer designed with **backend agnosticism**, **session persistence**, and **thread-safe server rotation**.

## âœ… Feature Checklist

- âœ… **Systems-level concurrency control**
- âœ… **Custom data structures (doubly circular linked list round-robin for server scheduling)**
- âœ… **Cookie-based load balancing strategy**
- âœ… **Functional Tests to guarantee thread safety and validated server insertion, deletion, and traversal edge cases (single node, full rotation, and empty state)**
- âœ… **Redis-backed distributed session storage**

## ðŸ§  Design Overview

### Load Balancing Strategy

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Doubly Circular Linked List (Round Robin)** | Maintains the active server pool. Each request rotates through nodes in a lock-safe manner. |
| **Injected Session Cookie** | The first response assigns a backend ID to the client. Subsequent requests can be routed to any backend server as the redis allows for agnosticism. |
| **Redis Session Store** | Holds all user session data centrally so backends remain stateless and interchangeable. |
| **Thread-Safety Guarantees** | The server list is stress-tested under concurrency to ensure no race conditions  |

## Environment Configuration & Building

### Server File:

setup your ports like so in a file:

ðŸ”§ `servers.txt`

```
http://localhost:8000
http://localhost:8001
http://localhost:8080
http://localhost:8081
http://localhost:5000
http://localhost:3000
http://localhost:8888
http://localhost:5173
```

## Usage


Start the Redis store:

```docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name lb_redis_store redis```

The load balancer takes the following flags:

-f servers.txt
-p loadBalancerPort

The full command looks something like:

```./main -f servers.txt -p 7777```


### Notes:

If your backends use JWTs or another stateless session mechanism, you likely donâ€™t need Redis for session routing. The session information is contained in the JWT and sent with every request, so any backend can handle it without sticky sessions.
